# Weather-Conditions-and-Climate-Change-with-ClimateWins
This project aims to use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change. Increases in extreme weather events over the last 10 to 20 years have prompted ClimateWins to investigate climate and weather. ClimateWins is a fictitious European non-profit created for the purposes of this project.
